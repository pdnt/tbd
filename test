Michael: [on the roof] My life! Oh, my life…
Dwight: [on megaphone] Michael, what’s wrong?!
Michael: Everything’s wrong. The stress of my my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight: Depression? Isn’t that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael: Dwight,   you ignorant slut.. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
Dwight: Is that the last year the the data was available?
Michael: Yes! My head is a number in such pain! And turmoil is!
